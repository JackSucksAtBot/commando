This is not an official version of `discord.js-commando` this is a modified version for JackSucksAtBot (JackBot).

Here is the official commando link: [Github](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-commando).

# Changes Made:
The only changes I have made is updated most of the responses to reply with embeds etc. 

This is not meant for commercial use, this is being used as a dependency for my bot so I don't accidentally update and lose all of my changes.
